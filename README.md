# Neural-Style-Transfer
Implementing Neural Style Transfer with a trained VGG19 model (trained on the ImageNet dataset).

I have used concepts from Tenserflow 1.x as this was the version used in the course 4 of the deep learning specialization on Coursera, and is the version that I am familiar with. A lot of the code in the notebook has been borrowed from the Week 4 assignment on Neural Style Transfer. I wasn't really sure about how to implement this concept, hence I used the assignment as a starting point.

I felt that this would be a good first project to familiarize myself with Tensorflow and with the general workflow of a deep learning project.
